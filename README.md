## My process

I followed a [Jak zaczac programowac](https://www.youtube.com/@JZP) tutorial to help myself with JavaScript logic. Media queries and theme switcher is what I added later.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I tried desktop-first approach and I didn't like it. I find it as a bad way to code. Managing media queries later is a bit of mess. I learned how to use routing with `window.location.search`. I also tried other approach of creating html elements by JS (here, I created each element by separate function and I nested it later into one component).

I needed 10,5 hours to completed this app. I really enjoyed this challenge and it was my first work with such a big API. I didn't focus so much on CSS styling here.
